# Building
From the root directory (cuhacking_2020), run the command:
    `npm run-script build`

Alternatively, if the command doesn't work:
    `cd react-app`
    `npm run-script build`

Once that runs, there's a few extra steps:
    1. Copy over the build folder from react-app/build to build
    2. Copy the images folder into build/

# Running
To run the server, run the following command:
    `node server.js`

The server will listen on port 3000
